# Facial Recognition: Siamese Network

## Overview

This repository contains the code for facial recognition using a [Siamese network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_neural_network). The Siamese network is a type of neural network architecture particularly useful for one-shot learning tasks like facial recognition.
